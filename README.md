# Apr Operator
This charm deploys and operates `apr`, a tiny dice-rolling fastapi server.

It's obviously not about the workload.

This is a 'demo' charm repo for playing around with ideas on how to structure complex, large, real charms, pushing the boundaries of what patterns and best practices to adopt when setting off on some new large project.

It also tangentially investigates how to structure a universal charm: one that works on machine and kubernetes substrates.
